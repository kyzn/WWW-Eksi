WWW::Eksisozluk version 0.08
============================

This module provides a simple command line interface for eksisozluk,
which is a user-based web dictionary, a famous web site in Turkey since 1999.
You can get "debe" list (list of most voted entries from yesterday) by using
this module. You can also get list of popular topics.

	use WWW::Eksisozluk;
	my $eksi  = WWW::Eksisozluk->new();
	my @debe  = $eksi->debe_ids();
	my %popular = $eksi->popular();


This will return the entry id's of the online debe list. Element at index 0 will be a the first entry, 1 is second and so on.

You can also get details of an entry by only giving the entry id.

	my %entry = $eksi->entry($debe[0]);

Ideally, you should call these methods from an object. This will return a hash with the values below.

	'id' # is the id of the entry. it was already given by the user.
	'id_link' # is the direct link to the entry.
	'id_ref' # is the id of the reference entry. reference entry is the first entry of the day in the same topic. it might be equal to id.
	'date_accessed' # will show the date-time of the script running.

	'topic' # is the topic of the entry.
